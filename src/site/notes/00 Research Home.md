# Research

This page is currently under construction! I am trying to place all of my research projects in a visually appealing manner with [Obsidian Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas). In the meantime, feel free to navigate this page as a wiki using the links below.

# Research Projects

I am interested in the broad areas of decision-making and memory. I tend to prefer the normative approach for my research projects. I also like to use and develop general-purpose frameworks such as reinforcement learning.

## Ongoing

#### Focus

- [[Serotonin model\|Serotonin model]]
- [[Myochallenge\|Myochallenge]]
- [[DRA human experiments\|DRA human experiments]]
- [[DRA vs Max Ent RL\|DRA vs Max Ent RL]]
- [[Noise in the brain - the Acerbi conjecture\|Noise in the brain - the Acerbi conjecture]]

#### Slow burn

- [[Laurena's project\|Laurena's project]]

##### Forgotten

- [[Hypocampus\|Hypocampus]]
- [[Compositional GVFs\|Compositional GVFs]]
- [[Neuroscience Knowledge Base\|Neuroscience Knowledge Base]]
- [[RL w sensorimotor competence\|RL w sensorimotor competence]]
- [[Hierarchical RL\|Hierarchical RL]]
- [[DRA neuro paper\|DRA neuro paper]]

## Completed

- [[DRA\|DRA]]
- [[Serotonin immersion grant\|Serotonin immersion grant]]
- [[Optimal policy for multi-alternative decisions\|Optimal policy for multi-alternative decisions]]

## Half-baked ideas

Other than these, I also have some [[Seedling ideas\|Seedling ideas]] and [[Half-baked ideas\|Half-baked ideas]] which will hopefully evolve over time.
