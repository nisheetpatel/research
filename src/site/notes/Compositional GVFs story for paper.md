## Story for paper
### Core contributions
- a framework to learn from generic predictions
- properties:
	- interpretable/describable predictions
		- usual models either lack interpretability 
	- ultra-fast learning
		- under some assumptions for primitive behaviors:
			- low-entropy, different from each other, and must span the space

### Outlook
- related to options framework, but with a few crucial differences:
	- we identify constraints for options that allow ultra-fast learning
	- 
- could combine with language to generate on-line answers to questions
	- e.g. like in the logical options framework
