- [x] Slot machines appear in different but consistent locations
- [x] Reduce $\sigma: 5\rightarrow2.5$


My working hypothesis:

- RL is robust, but dumb and slow. Humans don't learn with RL
- They instead use imprecise but quick heuristics such as categorization to learn
- Ultimately, they do very often converge to the optimal solution
- What we have is a normative theory of how precisely agents should encode things in their memory, but what we are trying to do is apply is as a procedural theory of learning (and I think this is why we're struggling). The process may be abstracted away from the final solution that any form of learning converges to and that is what we are after.
