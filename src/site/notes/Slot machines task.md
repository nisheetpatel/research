# Slot machines task MOC

## Analyses MOC

- [[Basic analyses for slot machines task\|Basic analyses for slot machines task]]
- [[Hierarchical Bayesian models for slot machines\|Hierarchical Bayesian models for slot machines]]
- [[Analyses slot machines\|Analyses slot machines]]
- [[Roadmap slot machines v3.1\|Roadmap slot machines v3.1]]

## Results

For pilot v3.1, [[Results for slot machines pilot v3.1\|here are the results]]. Overall, they seem a lot more convincing than pilots v1 & v2, which were not nearly as good. Not only do we now have 61 subjects instead of 10, but we also did rigorous performance analyses, built proper hierarchical models, and developed better tests for model signatures than we did previously for the [[Results for slot machines pilot v3\|pooled analyses for v3]], which was criticized in [[Slot machines pilot v3 meeting\|the meeting]]. 


## Change log

#### Task

> [!tip] Suggestion for v4
> Display total earnings on the screen. This would tell the participants how well they're doing overall. This could be a bar or a number or both, and could be reset on each block or continued throughout.
> Antonio says this might lead them to change their strategy and might just be distracting.
