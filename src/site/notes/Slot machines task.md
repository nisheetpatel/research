# Slot machines task MOC

To do:
- [x] Email Liz to collect more participants (such that we have 50 good subjects total)
- [ ] Check robustness of classification:
	- [ ] leave 1/3rd of the data out & classify
		- [ ] randomly for each trial in test blocks
		- [ ] leave whole block out
- [ ] Make a note about discrepancy between frequency & stakes (Stakes: 25% more vs Freq: ? more)
	- [ ] We may want to do a 2nd experiment where frequency is not so important to show that more subjects are now classified as DRA or Stakes

- [ ] Model fitting & comparison
- [ ] 

## Analyses MOC

- [[Analyses slot machines\|Analyses slot machines]]
- [[Code roadmap slot machines v3.1\|Code roadmap slot machines v3.1]]

## Results

For pilot v3.1, [[Results for slot machines pilot v3.1\|here are the results]]. Overall, they seem a lot more convincing than pilots v1 & v2, which were not nearly as good. Not only do we now have 61 subjects instead of 10, but we also did rigorous performance analyses, built proper hierarchical models, and developed better tests for model signatures than we did previously for the [[Results for slot machines pilot v3\|pooled analyses for v3]], which was criticized in [[Slot machines pilot v3 meeting\|the meeting]].

#### Task

> [!tip] Suggestion for v4
> Display total earnings on the screen. This would tell the participants how well they're doing overall. This could be a bar or a number or both, and could be reset on each block or continued throughout.
> Antonio says this might lead them to change their strategy and might just be distracting.
