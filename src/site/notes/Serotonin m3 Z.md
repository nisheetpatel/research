# Meeting with Zach in Lisbon
Zach's first concern was that of not changing the story much. If we do, then he would have to completely rewrite the existing proposal which would be a lot of work. Ideally, we want something that goes with the story and he thought that it would be best to go for a novel, moonshot proposal. However, he found it quite hard to convince Alex. During this meeting, we talked about several interested ideas that could be strung together to form a range of models from the simplest and boring ideas to fairly complicated ones that would truly allow us to test what Serotonin might be doing in the brain.


## Basic sketch of Zach's immersion story


## A story of priors and evidence
The classic version of the story goes 

### Difference in lower vs higher level
It seems as if different systems are modulated differently. 
- Sensory and motor: 
	- More top-down control
	- Lower level stuff messed up
	- Up-weighting priors
- Decision-making:
	- More bottom-up control? Down-weighting priors

## Attention is all you need
This could happen because Serotonin may not directly be doing the job of error correction itself, but in fact, only the job of drawing attention to errors! When attention is drawn to a process, regardless of whether or not it was an error signal, that must affect the process at hand. For instance, if it was drawn to a perceptual process, depending on which level of hierarchy it was drawn to, the perceived scenery might change one way or another. On the other hand, if it was drawn to a decision process, depending on whether it had to do with the evidence presented to the subject or a belief that they held, it could sway the decision one way or another. 

We thus posit that Serotonin merely does the job of drawing attention to an otherwise transparent process.

### Difference in attentional control in naive vs experienced users
Our theory only makes assumptions about passive attentional control without delving into the fact that attention may otherwise also be drawn to processes by some other mechanism, say conscious control (for lack of a better word). Following this train of thought, one may expect differences in the behavior of naive psychedelics users vs experienced users. For naive users, they may simply be attending to things wherever Serotonin draws their attention by virtue of 

## Modeling
In order to have any realistic shot at modeling behavior where attention is modulated at different levels in the hierarchy of processing, we would have to use the most complex models of behavior that we know of: hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL).

Here's where things get really interesting. HRL
