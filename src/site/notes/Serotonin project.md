## Serotonin project

This is a super-exciting project that started when I was chatting with [Zach Mainen](https://mainenlab.org/) about psychedelics over a couple of conferences ([Cosyne](https://www.cosyne.org/), [Champalimaud Symposium](https://fchampalimaud.org/events/2022-champalimaud-research-symposium)). He proposed a very intriguing "theory of immersion", which we eventually ended up submitting together as an [[Serotonin immersion grant\|ERC Synergia grant]] (with [Alex Pouget](https://neurocenter-unige.ch/research-groups/alexandre-pouget/)). 

Our initial discussions helped shape the conjecture that serotonergic neurons may be encoding a state-prediction error signal, which is not new in and of itself - Zach and others have stated this previously. However, what we do in this project is come up with a framework to investigate this conjecture. 

Read my notes on [[The role of serotonin\|The role of serotonin]] to get more of a flavor of where we're coming from. We're marrying those ideas with the framework of [[Dynamical VAEs\|Dynamical VAEs]] and [Ha & Schmidhuber's world models](https://worldmodels.github.io/). The plan is to submit it to NeurIPS with their May 2023 deadline, and here are some more resources for the project:
