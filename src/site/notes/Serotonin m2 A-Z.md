# 5HT immersion

## Meeting with Alex & Zach
#### Stories
##### Old Story
- 5HT2A low aff long-lasting receptor. This sets the baseline.
- When psychedelics bind to 5HT2A, the baseline is higher.
- Thus, errors now need to cross this much higher threshold in order to be detected, and hence, a lot of them go undetected.
- This leads to stronger influence of priors, which is what leads to hallucinations.

##### New story
- 5HT signals prediction errors: attracts attention to otherwise transparent processes.


#### Priors
It might be the case the what happens in vision may be the opposite of what happens in decision making. For vision, it seems like you tend to trust your model much more, whereas for decisions, you give more of a chance to data and take a less biased approach. This may be generally applicable to sensory vs higher-order processes. 

In general, any of these three version
- More influence of priors
- Downweighting priors
	- More popular recently
- Complicated
	- Sophie Deneve's version. Prior is downweighted, evidence is upweighted, but if prior comes back in as evidence, you have a runaway loop.

#### Other data points
- Confidence
	- In monkeys, increased confidence in alpha &rarr; more weighting on priors.
	- But psychedelics open doors of perception, presumably because you are not stuck to your beliefs and are more open to trying new things, giving the data a chance.
- Adaptation and learning:
	- It seems like serotonin boosts learning and adaptation. Also plasticity of various kinds seem to be boosted by serotonin

###### Extras
- Read Friston and Carhart-Harris. Rebus model?
- 2A and 2C seem to have opposing effects
