# Questions of interest

- Why should an agent have memories? Also, what are memories?
- [[Active search\|Active search]]: Given a fixed set of memories and a representational structure that links the memories, which ones ought to be searched in order to help make the current decision?
	- Mattar and Daw miss the whole point of relation of memories. In fact, in their case, memories will be diffused
- [[Adaptive representation\|Adaptive representation]]: Given a fixed search mechanism, can an agent adapt its representation in order to maximize some utility function?
- [[Todorovian model\|Todorovian model]]: Decompose the bigger RL problem into a set of smaller problems, each of which can be solved by dedicated networks. Ideas we've been discussing with Reidar.
