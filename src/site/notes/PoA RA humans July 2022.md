### Look up relevant literature
- [Polania, Woodford, Ruff. *Nat Neuro* (2019) ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0292-0)
	- other papers related to this one, esp. experimental
- Optimal coding theory
	- for sensory domain (ours for long term memory)
- Key ideas to look for:
	- encoding precision of choice in a reward setting
- get back to Antonio et al. with these


- [x] send email to wei ji
	- [x] ask about what he knows re. precision encoding in long term memory
	- [x] cc lui and alex

### Look up Prolific
- can I code experiment in prolific?
	- no, it is just to recruit participants
	- experiment can be coded on psychopy, uploaded to pavlovia, and then participants can be recruited on prolific
	- here's a [quick guide](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/550f325ae4b0f7f604ae9822/t/5e6bba7d810aeb77251eb9d4/1584118397102/SHlabOnlineStudyHRB.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjfiJiD05n5AhUMhZQKHfZXAPoQFnoECE8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw3fC_RQhxMPLQF3tPu0OPgv)
- talk to Alex about whether I need help of people from Daphne's lab
- get back to Antonio re. this
