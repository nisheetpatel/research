We're in the 21st century, and yet our publication systems have not fully adapted the new technology available, nor adapted to how our brains capture, represent, and relate different pieces of information. During a Bernstein conference over the pandemic, a bunch of us enthusiastic grad students decided to come up with a community-driven wiki that captures the *Big ideas in neuroscience*. Here's what we had discussed at the time.

# New model for a neuroscience knowledge base

## Crucial aspects

##### Freely available
- For far too long, people have been too greedy and this gets in the way of advancing science.
- Textbooks and journals typically come with a high price tag, though there is good pressure in recent times forcing a push in the right direction.
- We want this resource to be freely available to anyone who wants it


##### Community-driven

- No one person, not even a group of people, will have the complete knowledge to chart out this resource
- Moreover, no one should have such authority to dictate the evolution of the web of knowledge
- If papers are published

##### Dynamic

Ideas evolve constantly. What we believed yesterday no longer remains true today. The resource must get updated at the speed of ideas rather than when someone chooses to publish a new book, or a new review paper.

##### Non-linear structure

- For far too long, we have adopted a linear structure to logically follow cogent arguments. However, the overarching stories are never linear. 
- Focuses on links rather than one linear story or hierarchical structure.


##### Focus on understanding ideas and big questions rather than the nitty-gritty details
 
- A core problem of a lot of science is that the content tends to be dry. This is a classic trade-off: too much rigor renders the content dry and difficult to consume, but on the other hand, popularizing it inevitably results in the loss of accuracy to varying degrees of unacceptability.
- We would review all content to have a form that focuses on understanding the core idea
- The details can be linked to the main arguments, but the argument should remain brief. 
- Evidence, proofs, and other dense materials should be delegated in order not to obscure the core of the argument.

##### Reviewing

- We need to figure out a model of reviewing the content in two crucial aspects: form and content 

##### Inspirational

- a long-term goal would be to have independent artists - illustrators, poets, musicians, etc. - collaborate with the people who contributed to the core ideas to create art that is linked to the science.

## Resources to be used

#### Obsidian

- To keep markdown notes
- To build a web of knowledge

#### LYT toolkit

- Built-in ideas of knowledge building

#### Obsidian Publish

- For the website
- To showcase the web of knowledge to the community that is easily navigable

#### Github

- For ease of contributions and to keep track of who contributed to what parts of our community's neuroscience knowledge base
- This might be the SoTA model to keep track of credits since every sentence can be tracked to a person
- People can simply create a pull request to upload the set of ideas to the web of knowledge
