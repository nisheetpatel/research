# Research Projects

I am interested in the broad areas of decision-making and memory. I tend to prefer the normative approach for my research projects. I also like to use and develop general-purpose frameworks such as reinforcement learning.

## Ongoing

## Half-baked ideas

Other than these, I also have some [[Seedling ideas\|Seedling ideas]] and [[Half-baked ideas\|Half-baked ideas]] which will hopefully evolve over time.
