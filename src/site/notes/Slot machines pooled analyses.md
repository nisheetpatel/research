#DRA #human-memory #slot-machines

## Non-Bayesian

- Pool the data, fit and plot logit for each slot machine
	- For all blocks combined
	- Individually for each block
- Individually for each (subject, SM). Show plot per subject

> [!tip] Important note:
> Pooled data tells us absolutely nothing. For example, if half the subjects follow a frequency-based strategy and the other half follow a stakes-based strategy, the pooled data will show DRA-like trend in the slopes of the psychometric curves. Moreover, we might be capturing effects based on "wisdom of the crowd" which no individual might be following.
