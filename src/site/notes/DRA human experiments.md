# Tasks

See full details in [[Tasks to test RA in humans\|Tasks to test RA in humans]]

#### *Bottleneck task*

- Beautiful one developed by moi
- Unfortunately, we cannot use it because we would have very limited data

#### *2AFC task*

- [[Psychopy 2AFC experiment\|Psychopy 2AFC experiment]]
- Boring but does the job
- Needs much fewer trials, I believe
- Implemented a special precision-measuring task
- Works great in theory, but in practice, we found that subjects "cheat" by solving a simpler task instead

#### *Slot machine task*

- [[Slot machines task\|Slot machines task]]
- Currently piloting. 
- We find that at the group-level, subjects do follow the strategy we expect them to. Doing some hella rigorous analyses to verify this
